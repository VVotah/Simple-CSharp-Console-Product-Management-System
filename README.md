# Simple C# Console Product Management System
This Repo contains a simple console-based application written in C#. It was created as a submission for a live coding final exam (UAS). The program allows a user to perform basic product management tasks through a command-line menu.  The application can add a single product by storing its ID and name, and then verify the existence of that product.
